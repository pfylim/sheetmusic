For First-time Users

It is recommended that Adobe Acrobat Reader be installed
before installing CD Sheet Music. For optimal performance,
versions of Adobe Acrobat Reader prior to 4.0 should be
removed.

For future use it is not necessary to reinstall either
Adobe Acrobat Reader or CD Sheet Music. Simply launch
CD Sheet Music directly, using the "OPEN" Command button
on the startup screen, or use the Desktop Shortcut/Icon.

Newer versions of CD Sheet Music are compatible with all
older versions. It is not necessary or recommended to
uninstall older versions of CD Sheet Music as the new 
versions overwrite the older Desktop Shortcut/Icon. Newer
versions provide enhanced functionality.

HELPFUL HINT:      To navigate more easily through the
CD Sheet Music files, simply go to FILE/PREFERENCES/GENERAL
and uncheck the option box for "OPEN CROSS-DOC LINKS IN
SAME WINDOW." This will allow you to keep your position in
the table of contents. This function can only be achieved
after Adobe Acrobat Reader is installed.
